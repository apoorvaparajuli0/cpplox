A WIP implementation of jlox in C++ following along with Robert Nystrom's book, [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

# Credits
* Thanks to Shantanu Goel, his [article](https://shantanugoel.com/2020/04/27/java-object-cpp-std-variant/) on the C++ std::variant helped me figure out how to approach representing literals in my implementation of cpplox
* Thanks to Vilho Luoma, I was having issues with implementing the visitor pattern in C++ and I took a look at his jlox [implementation](https://github.com/vilbedawg/jlox-cpp/tree/master) which is listed on the Crafting Interpreters implementations list.
